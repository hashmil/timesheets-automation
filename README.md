Create variables with your username and password. Then create a request session to login to the website. Use ‘inspect element’ on your browser to find the fields and their ID in the HTML. You may have to adjust the code to fit what you find in your timesheet website.

the `job_number_field` is where you can enter the job ID or job number for your project. And the `monday_hours_field` (and subsequent days) are where you can enter the number of hours worked on.
